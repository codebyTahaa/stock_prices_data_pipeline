Stock Prices ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow
📄 Project Overview
This project implements an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow to fetch, process, and store stock market prices.
The goal is to schedule daily data extraction from external APIs or CSVs, apply necessary transformations, and save the clean data into a storage/database for further analysis..

🚀 Technologies Used
Apache Airflow – Workflow orchestration and scheduling

Python – Scripting and ETL logic

Pandas – Data manipulation and transformation

PostgreSQL / CSV – Data storage (depending on setup)

Docker (optional) – For containerized deployment

🔄 Workflow Details
Extract
Fetch real-time or historical stock prices from a data source (API or CSV).

Transform
Clean, filter, and format the data — handling missing values, changing data types, etc.

Load
Save the processed data into a database like PostgreSQL, or local storage as CSV files.

Schedule
Airflow DAG schedules the ETL to run daily at a specific time.

📅 DAG Design
Task 1: Start

Task 2: Extract stock data

Task 3: Transform stock data

Task 4: Load data into storage

Task 5: End

Tasks are dependent sequentially to ensure proper ETL flow.

⚙️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prices-airflow.git
cd stock-prices-airflow
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Airflow services:

bash
Copy
Edit
airflow db init
airflow scheduler
airflow webserver
Trigger the DAG from Airflow UI.

(Or use docker-compose up if Docker is set up.)

📈 Future Improvements
Add alerts in case of pipeline failure

Support multiple stock exchanges

Implement historical data backfilling

Integrate with cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP)
